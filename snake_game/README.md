# Snake Game 

  This is s simple snake game made with pygame, that can be played by one or two players
  
The rules of the games that I followed were:

— Start screen ask for number of players, you should press key from your keyboard(1 or 2)

— Playground is generated with player/players and an apple

— Player one moves snake with arrows, colored green

— Second player moves snake with keys = 'a', 'w', 's', 'd', colored blue

— The goal is to eat apples, colored red

— After the apple is eaten on the playground new apple appear on random position  

— Snake cannot cross border of the playground   

— Snake cannot eat itself, cannot touch its body

— Snake can move through an opponent snake

— If some  rule is broken game ends and on the screen score is displayed, score is how many apples snake has eaten

— If game is played with two players, the player with higher score wins   



Enjoy!
